            <div>
                <p>
                    Q1: Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX
                    when I call 'root.render()'?
                </p>
                <p className="bg-slate-700 p-3">
                    A1: Well, it's depend where I set the location. By default
                    it is in a 'div' with id name 'root'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q2: What would show up in my console if I were to run this
                    line of code:
                    <br />
                    console.log(&lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;)
                </p>
                <p className="bg-slate-700 p-3">A2: An Object!</p>
                <p>
                    Q3: What's wrong with this code:
                    <br />
                    root.render(
                    <br />
                    &lt;h1&gt;Hi there&lt;/h1&gt;
                    <br />
                    &lt;p&gt;This is my website!&lt;/p&gt;
                    <br />)
                </p>
                <p className="bg-slate-700 p-3">
                    A3: React can't render multiple elements. We always have to wrap our all elements into a single element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q4: What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
                </p>
                <p className="bg-slate-700 p-3">
                    A4: Imperative means we need to give step-by-step instructions to complete a task.<br />On the other hand, Declarative means we just need to tell what we want to show, the tool or React will handle the progress on how to do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q5: What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
                </p>
                <p className="bg-slate-700 p-3">
                    A5: Composable means some small pieces of reusable codes or something that could be join together to make a large application.
